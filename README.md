## Live demo
Try it out: [laravel-api-tester.asva.by](http://laravel-api-tester.asva.by/)

## Disclaimer

Image and demo are from `development` branch. Got the courage? Give it a try:
```
composer require asvae/laravel-api-tester:dev-development
```

## Installation

Require this package with composer:

```
composer require asvae/laravel-api-tester
```

After updating composer, add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in config/app.php

```
Asvae\ApiTester\ServiceProvider::class,
```

That's it. Go to `[your site]/api-tester` and start testing routes. 

## Config

By default, the package is bound to `APP_DEBUG` `.env` value. But you can easily override it. Just publish config:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Asvae\ApiTester\ServiceProvider"
```

And edit `config/api-tester.php` as you please.
